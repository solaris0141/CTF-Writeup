HackTheBox CyberApocalypse 2024 
=====

Once again we are back to HackTheBox Cyber Apocalypse this year with the theme Hacker Royale from 9 to 13 March. As usual there are a huge variety of challenges and I was thrilled to try and see how much I have improved from last year.
This year I managed to solve 6 crypto, 3 forensics and 2 hardware, which certainly exceeded my last year's result of only able to solve 3 crypto. I do hope I will be able to solve all 10 crypto for next year's Cyber Apocalypse and maybe start getting my hands dirty in rev and blockchain as well.
